TFT Quiz Application to RIOT for the approval

<p>TFT Quiz is a typical quiz game in TeamFight Tactics style. It allows people to remember items, combinations from the original TFT game.</p>
<p>There are 3 modes: Training (2 attempts), Timer (300 seconds and infinite attempts), Competitive (1 attempt and 6 seconds to answer) </p>
<p>The best results are implemented using the Google Play Leaderboards for Timer and Competitive modes separately.</p>
<b>I did not use APIs.</b>
<p>I used in the application pictures of: TFT items, Little Legends, and also several sounds and button sprites from TFT mobile version.</p>
<p>I want to add that people like to play this game, this application received nice feedback.</p>
<p><b>I attach screenshots, also you can watch video trailer here: https://youtu.be/r08BUZvTSCc </b></p>

Best wishes,  Yevhenii</p>
